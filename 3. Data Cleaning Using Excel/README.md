### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Steps taken to clean and prepare this dataset:

**1. Checked if there are duplicates. No duplicate was found.**

**2. Deleted the column named 'gross margin'.**

**3. Created a new column named 'Total (without taxes)' and filled the column.**

**4. Deleted 'total (without taxes)' with equation and copied it another column with only values.**

**5. Swapped diffrerent columns to make the sheet look presentable.**

**6. Used conditional formatting to create a header for sorting..**

### Conclusion:
After cleaning and preparing the data, I've created three pivot tables and three charts <br>
only to found that the data is equally distributed. So, I've come to the conclusion that, <br>
this is a fake dataset. That's the reason I've only cleaned it but didn't analayzed it.
